1. What new region do you believe we focus on expanding in and why?
Recommendation: Focus on expanding accounts in Latin America due to a large amount of usage per account in this region.
Details:
        ◦ The Latin America (LATAM) region currently only has one account with usage, but this account has had high total usage since June 2021 (Quantity: 1,088,732)
        ◦ There is the opportunity to greatly expand usage if additional accounts were opened in LATAM if these accounts would have similar usage to the current account in the region.
          
2. Are there any accounts we should focus on expanding?
       
Recommendation: Expand the top 5 accounts based on usage, since these accounts drive the majority of usage for all accounts.
Details:
    • The top 5 accounts by usage have close to 68% of the usage quantity (Quantity: 67,317,574)
    • There are 157 accounts that are not included in the top 5 accounts by usage quantity. These accounts combined make up only 32% of the total usage quantity.
    • The Tableau reports forecast for December predicts the quantity of usage to be 12.8 million for the top 5 accounts by usage, and only 5 million for all other accounts.
      
3. Any other recommendation that stands out to you during your analysis.
